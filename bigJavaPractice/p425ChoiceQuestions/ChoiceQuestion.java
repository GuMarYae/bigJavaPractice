    /**
     * This function right here is NOT asking the user anything.
     * It ONLY sets up the question behind the scenes.
     * 
     * What it does:
     * - Adds the answer choice (right or wrong) into the list called 'choices'
     * - If the answer is correct (true), it saves the position of that answer (as a
     * string)
     * - That saved string gets stored using setAnswer() from the parent class
     * 
     * Why it saves the number as a string:
     * - Because later when the user answers, they enter something like "1" or "2"
     * - The program compares that to the string stored by this function
     * 
     * Important:
     * - choices.size() gives the total number of choices AFTER this one is added
     * - So if you're adding the 3rd answer, size becomes 3, and "3" is saved as the
     * correct answer
     * 
     * Again â€” THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT INTERACT WITH THE USER.
     * It just builds the question in the background.
